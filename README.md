# HesaiLidar_Swift_ROS 

## About the project 
This repository includes the ROS Driver for Pandar LiDAR sensor manufactured by Hesai Technology. Branches are included for different systems and UDP protocol versions.

Developed based on [HesaiLidar_Swift_SDK](https://github.com/HesaiTechnology/HesaiLidar_Swift_SDK), After launched, the project will monitor UDP packets from Lidar,parse data and publish point clouds frames into ROS under topic: ```/pandar_points```. It can also be used as an official demo showing how to work with [HesaiLidar_Swift_SDK](https://github.com/HesaiTechnology/HesaiLidar_Swift_SDK).

## Branches 
```
* master: Pandar LiDAR ROS driver for Ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu20.04 supports the latest UDP protocol v1.4 v1.3 and v3.2 
* UDP1.4_ubuntu16.04: Pandar LiDAR ROS driver for Ubuntu 16.04 supports the latest UDP protocol v1.4
* UDP1.3: Pandar LiDAR ROS driver for ubuntu16.04,ubuntu 18.04 and Ubuntu 20.04 supports UDP protocol v1.3 

To get the UDP protocol version number of your device,  check the UDP package header field.
```

## Configuration 
```
 $ cd src/HesaiLidar_Swift_ROS/pandar_pointcloud/launch
```
open PandarSwift_points.launch to set configuration parameters

### Reciving data from connected LiDAR: config LiDAR IP address & UDP port, and leave the pcap_file empty

|Parameter | Default Value|
|---------|---------------|
|device_ip |192.168.1.201|
|port |2368|
|pcap_file ||

Data source will be read from connected LiDAR when "pcap_file" is set to empty

### Reciving data from pcap file: config pcap_file and correction file path

|Parameter | Value|
|---------|---------------|
|pcap |pcap file path|
|calibration|lidar calibration file path|　

Data source will be read from pcap file instead of LiDAR once "pcap_file" not empty


## Run

### View the point clouds from connected LiDAR

1. Make sure current path in the `rosworkspace` directory
```
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ roslaunch pandar_pointcloud PandarSwift_points.launch
```

2. The driver will publish a PointCloud2 message in the topic.
```
/pandar_points
```

3. Open Rviz and add display by topic.

4. Change fixed frame to "PandarSwift" to view published point clouds.

### View the point clouds from rosbag file

1. Make sure current path in the `rosworkspace` directory
```
$ source devel/setup.bash
$ roslaunch pandar_pointcloud PandarSwift_points.launch
```

2. The driver will publish a raw data packet message in the topic.
```
/pandar_packets
```
3. record raw data rosbag
```
$rosbag record -b 4096 /hesai/pandar_packets
```

4. stop roslaunch and rosbag record by "Ctrl + C"

5. play raw data rosbag
```
$rosbag play <rosbagfile>
```

6. launch transform_nodelet.launch
```
$ roslaunch pandar_pointcloud transform_nodelet.launch data_type:=rosbag
```
7. Open Rviz and add display by topic.
8. Change fixed frame to "PandarSwift" to view published point clouds.
